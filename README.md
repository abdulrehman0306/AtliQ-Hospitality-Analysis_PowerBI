# AtliQ-Hospitality-Analysis_PowerBI:

## Problem statement:
Atliq Grands, a luxury hotel chain with several five-star properties across India, has been operating in the hospitality sector for over two decades. Recently, the company has faced a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel segment due to aggressive competition and less effective management decisions. To counteract this downturn, Atliq Grands decided to implement data-driven decision-making and leverage business intelligence. However, lacking an internal analytics team, they outsourced the task of extracting valuable insights from their historical data to external data analysts.

## Objective:

As a data analyst, I was tasked with analyzing the provided historical data and building a comprehensive dashboard. The project included creating specific metrics as outlined by the stakeholders, developing a dashboard following a provided mock-up, and uncovering additional insights beyond the given metrics.

## Key Responsibilities:

-  Develop metrics in alignment with the list provided by stakeholders.
-  Design and build a dashboard using advanced data visualization techniques based on the stakeholder's mock-up.
-  Analyze the data to generate further insights that go beyond the predefined metrics and mock-up.
